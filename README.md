# Saguaro Detection

This project involves using computer vision to detect shadows of saguaro cactus in digital aerial imagery. Saguaro National Park has been doing research of saguaro distribution for decades, but has not done large-scale studies due to the large size of the park and limited resources. High resolution aerial photos of the park show saguaro shadows as easily identifiable unique features. I wrote a Python algorithm to scan the images and detect patterns of shadows that are indicative of saguaro cactus. This was done by calculating the sun agle and rating the pixels based on the shape of the shadow in relation to a typical saguaro shadow signature. The algorithm identified nearly 500,000 indiviudals across the park's two districts and provided the first large-scale density map of the park's saguaros. The results of this project were peer reviewed and [published](http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.JRS.12.036016) in the Journal of Applied Remote Sensing.
